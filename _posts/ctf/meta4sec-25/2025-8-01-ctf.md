# 🧩 Challenge Overview

We are provided with a zip archive. After extracting it, we get the following files:

```
flag.txt  output_test.txt  readme.md  test.txt
```

## 📄 readme.md

```md
A mysterious message has been intercepted, and according to analysts, it appears to be encrypted with an unusual twist on a traditional cipher.

Luckily, we have a sample of both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, which seems to be encrypted using the same method as the flag.

Your task is to:
1. Identify the encryption pattern by comparing the known plaintext and ciphertext.
2. Use this pattern to decrypt the flag in `flag.txt`.

===[ Files ]===

- test.txt            # known plaintext
- output_test.txt     # corresponding ciphertext
- flag.txt            # encrypted flag

===[ Objective ]===

Retrieve the original flag from `flag.txt`.

Flag format: `Meta4Sec{...}`

Brute-forcing isn't required to solve this, but you’re welcome to try. A logical approach and familiarity with classic ciphers will be more effective.

Good luck!

## 🎯 Task Summary

Based on the information in `readme.md`, the main objective is to analyze the encryption used in `test.txt` and `output_test.txt`, and then apply the same logic to decrypt `flag.txt`.

## 🔍 Sample Analysis

### From `output_test.txt`:
```
Sheajra Shaal suat bkeunt einskpri taeurt dmaal sheajra dna mhais saendaehr ahdaal einskpri mneankgagnu aalmgtoir
```

### From `test.txt`:
```
Sejarah Salah satu bentuk enkripsi tertua dalam sejarah dan masih sederhana adalah enkripsi menggunakan algoritma
```

Let’s examine the encryption of the word `Sejarah` ~> `Sheajra`.

| Index | Original | Encrypted |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0     | S        | S         |
| 1     | e        | h         |
| 2     | j        | e         |
| 3     | a        | a         |
| 4     | r        | j         |
| 5     | a        | r         |
| 6     | h        | a         |

We observe the following transformation:
- index[0] stays the same ~> `S`
- index[1] becomes index[6]
- index[2] becomes index[1]
- index[3] becomes index[5]
- index[4] becomes index[2]
- index[5] becomes index[4]
- index[6] becomes index[3]

`bentuk` ~> `bkeunt`

| Index | Original | Encrypted |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0     | b        | b         |
| 1     | e        | k         |
| 2     | n        | e         |
| 3     | t        | u         |
| 4     | u        | n         |
| 5     | k        | t         |

- index[0] stays the same → `b`
- index[1] becomes index[5]
- index[2] becomes index[1]
- index[3] becomes index[5]
- index[4] becomes index[2]
- index[5] becomes index[4]

This suggests a fixed permutation pattern
This insight gives us a solid base to reverse the process and decrypt the flag.

> solver.py

```python
def encode(s:str) -> str:
    result = []
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        result.append(s[i])
        result.append(s[n - 1 - i])
    if n % 2 == 1:
        result.append(s[n // 2])
    return ''.join(result)

def decode(s:str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    result = [''] * n
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    idx = 0
    for i in range(n // 2):
        result[left] = s[idx]
        result[right] = s[idx + 1]
        idx += 2
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    if n % 2 == 1:
        result[left] = s[idx]
    return ''.join(result)


with open('flag.txt','r') as f:
    enc = f.read().split()
decrypted = []
for j in enc:
    decrypted.append(decode(j))

print(' '.join(decrypted))
```
